# How the baseline InversifyJS project/app was created

```text
> yarn init
> yarn add node reflect-metadata
> yarn add typescript --dev
> mkdir src
> git init
```

Then:

* Created src\index.ts
* Created the tsconfig.json
* Added script directives to package.json
* Opened directory in VS Code and create launch configuration and task
* Created .gitignore
* git commit, git remote add, and git push
